          <h1>I'm William. A product designer from Sweden.</h1>
          <p>Designer at Plentific, alumni of the Interactive Art Director programme at Hyper Island in Stockholm, Sweden (where I graduated "With Distinction"). Bachelor Degree in PR & Communication from University of Gothenburg.</p>
          <p>Hip hop addicted, rookie pasta-goes-with-anything chef and amateur football player. I tell myself I'm decent at football, but deep down I know I'm just watching a lot, perhaps not playing as well as much as I'm watching it.</p>
          <p>Born 1991 and raised in the mud from GÃ¶ta River in Gothenburg. Calm and enamored. I try to consistently evolve my hobbies & passions, and the greatest one is design.</p>
          <p>Today that passion has given me a position as Product designer at Tink, a fintech company in Stockholm. Previously I worked as Lead Designer for Plentific, a search market for people to find a Professional for their next home improvement project.</p>
